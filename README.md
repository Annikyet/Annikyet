Hi, I'm Annika 👩🏼‍💻

I'm a full-stack software developer with a background in data analysis. I have a passion for good design and elegant solutions to problems. I'm always thinking about how to make UX better, and how to optimize everything for maximum efficiency. I feel a deep connection to the natural world and am deeply greatful for mother nature.

- 📜 I'm currently working on completing my full-stack certification from Boise CodeWorks. And I plan to continue to learn new technologies and solutions going forward.

- 🌳 I'm decently good with the following: HTML - CSS - JavaScript - Bootstrap - Tailwind - Vue.js - Node.js - Express.js - Python - SQL - MVCS Patterns - Tableau

- 🗻 I'm eager to learn and use these: Nuxt.js - C#/.NET - Swift - embedded C - Verilog

 - 💬 Feel free to reach out to me!

  - 📸 Fun fact: I'm a total hipster at heart and love learning about and using vintage cameras and computers

I leave you with the words of Carl Sagan:
  ```
  The cosmos is within us. We are made of star-stuff. We are a way for the universe to know itself.
  ```
