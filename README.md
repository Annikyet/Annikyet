Hi, I'm Annika 👩🏼‍💻

I'm a full-stack software developer with a background in data analysis. I have a passion for good design and elegant solutions to problems. I'm always thinking about how to make better, more accessible UX, and how to write clean, readable and efficient code. I feel a deep connection to the natural world and am deeply greatful for mother nature.

- 📜 I've successfully completed my full-stack certification from Boise CodeWorks, but I am always learning new technologies, ideas and solutions.

- 🌳 I'm decently good with the following: HTML - CSS - JavaScript - Bootstrap - Tailwind - Vue.js - Node.js - Express.js - Axios - Python - SQL - MVCS Patterns - Tableau - C#/.NET

- 🗻 I'm eager to learn and use these: Nuxt.js - Go - React.js - Swift - embedded C - Verilog

 - 💬 Feel free to reach out to me!

  - 📸 Fun fact: I'm a total hipster at heart and love learning about and using vintage cameras and computers
